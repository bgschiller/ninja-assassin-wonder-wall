Title: The Ninja Assassin Wonderwall Game

In this summer camp game, each of n players chooses one person to be their Ninja Assassin and another to be their Wonderwall. When the game starts, each player runs to try to keep their Wonderwall on the line between themself and their Ninja Assassin. 

We create an algorithm, based on finding cycles in directed graphs, that creates a configuration satisfying every player's constraints or says that no such configuration exists. We also use a computer model to estimate the probability that a given game has such a configuration.
